# top-rookie-running-backs-2019
Small project using python to scrape statistics of the top 24 NFL rookie running backs from pro-football-reference.com and place their statistics in a clean dataset

As a huge fan of football I want to compare the 2019 rookie class of running backs, particularly Miles Sanders (GO EAGLES!)
